## Master CLI

A batteries-included Node.js web application toolkit for building data-backed apps with clear layers: routing, controllers, views, sockets, and records. Master focuses on convention over configuration to help you scaffold and ship fast.

Under the hood, the runtime uses two companion libraries:
- mastercontroller: Provides the HTTP server, routing, controller base methods, templating hooks, sessions, requests, CORS, sockets, and more.
- masterrecord: Lightweight data-access layer for models/records.

The CLI ties these together so you can generate apps and features with a single command.

### Features at a glance
- Project scaffolding with sensible defaults
- Generators for controllers, views, sockets, and full scaffolds
- File-based routing via `config/routes.js`
- Server bootstrap via `mastercontroller`
- Optional realtime via Socket.IO
- Cross-platform (macOS, Windows, Linux)

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g master
```

From a clone of this repo for local development/testing:

```bash
npm install -g ./
```

Verify installation:

```bash
master --version
```

---

## Quick start

```bash
master new myapp
cd myapp
master server
```

Visit the server output URL (default http://localhost:8080 if configured) and you should see the starter page.

## Commands

```bash
master help                # Show help and available commands
master server              # Start the HTTP server
master new <name>          # Scaffold a new application in ./<name>
master generate controller <Name> [actions...]   # Add a controller and empty views
master generate view <Name> [actions...]         # Add a view folder and files
master generate socket <Name>                    # Add a socket file
master generate scaffold <Name>                  # Controller + routes + views + socket
```

Examples:

```bash
master generate controller Users index show new create edit update
master generate view Users index show
master generate socket Chat
```

## How it works

When you run `master server`, your app’s `server.js` boots the runtime from mastercontroller and wires up built-in modules:

```12:13:master/server.js
var server =  master.setupServer("http");
master.start(server);
```

The app structure follows clear layers:

- app/controllers: Controller classes with actions that return views or data.
- app/views: HTML templates rendered by controller actions.
- app/sockets: Socket handlers for realtime features.
- config/routes.js: Route declarations (the CLI can append resources here).
- config/initializers: Environment, request parsing, CORS, and MIME settings.

Controllers are simple classes with action methods:

```1:13:master/app/controllers/homeController.js
const master = require('mastercontroller');

class homeController{
  constructor(){}
  index(){
    return this.returnView();
  }
}

module.exports = homeController;
```

Record/model access is provided by masterrecord (add models in your app and require masterrecord as needed). This separation keeps HTTP/controller responsibilities distinct from data access.

## Project structure

```
app/
  controllers/
  views/
  sockets/
config/
  routes.js
  initializers/
public/
server.js
```

---

## Configuration

Key settings live in `config/initializers` and `config/environments`:

- `config/initializers/request.*`: Multipart/form-data parsing and upload limits.
- `config/initializers/cors.*`: Origins, methods, headers, and credentials.
- `config/initializers/mime.*`: Allowed MIME types.
- `config/environments/env.*.json`: Hostname, port, request timeout, error pages.

Set environment when starting the server:

```bash
master=development node server.js
```

## Cross-platform notes

The CLI uses Node’s `path.join` and `fs-extra` to work consistently across macOS, Windows, and Linux. Run commands from your app root.
